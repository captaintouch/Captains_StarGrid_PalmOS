Hello pilots! Are you ready to battle it out in the StarGrid arena?

StarGrid is a  turn-based strategy game for Palm OS (in 2025!) where you command a fleet of ships in a battle for control of the galaxy. 

Capture enemy flags, outmaneuver opposing fleets, and defend your own base in tense, tactical matches. Every move counts, will you strike boldly or play the long game to claim victory?
